# ERP Clean Script

This script processes an ERP downloaded file, which is assumed to be a `.csv` file. It cleans the data, processes the amounts, and creates separate CSV files for cleaned and discarded values. It also adds debit, credit, and balance columns to the cleaned data.

## Prerequisites
Before running the script, make sure Python and `pip` are installed on your system.

### Install Python and pip
sudo apt update
sudo apt install python3 python3-pip -y

### Install the Dependencies
